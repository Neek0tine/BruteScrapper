## What is it?
**HOW TO WEBSCRAP** is a joint repository of the three musketeers whose goal is just one: **Avoid anti-bot websites**

## Why did I make this?
There are three main phases on anti-bot website difficulty. 
* ### Requests
The first one is the Requests phase. First, a web scrapper will try to do a requests using a standard requests library or urllib3 for those who are special. This mostly works nicely before 2015.
After 2015 however, the big sites usually just block requests and throw a 400 Error code or just a blank page at us. We forgive those who blocks requests but also gives us an API to use. For those who blocks requests that
and isn't giving a single endpoint of API, now that's what this repos is for.

* ### Selenium
The second phase is selenium phase. Back then selenium driver is really powerful. Scrapping with selenium back then is like bringing an 155mm L/39 calibre M777 howitzer to a pillow fight. An absolute overkill of a weapon.
However, sites now checks your browser fingerprints too?! What is this?! Why do you really oppose us? What did we do wrong? (Me personally did not send 10000 requests per second, but for those who did is probably at fault here)

* ### PyAutoIt - PyAutoGUI 
Okay, this is the last resort. If you can't control my browser, control my mouse. Move my mouse, press my browser, type the link I want to go, and manually-automatically copies all the info required. I'm not sure if this is a stone age technology
or an absolute breakthrough of an innovation. This feels like bruteforcing our way in, but anything for those sweet sweet datas amiright?
